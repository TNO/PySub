    "# PySub Tutorial 1 - Calculating compaction and subsidence\n",
    "Welcome to the first example case for building, running and displaying subsidence model using the PySub package, from an Excel template. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to built a model from an example Excel file. The case we are studying is a fictional gas or liquid extraction for which we know the resulting presure drop. The goal is to familiarize you with the PySub model, it's syntax and functionality. For how to fill in the Excel work sheet, we divert you to this tutorial (.../python-subsidence/Documentation/Intructions Template SubsidenceModelGas.docx). In addition, we show some quick methods on how to display subsidence. \n",
