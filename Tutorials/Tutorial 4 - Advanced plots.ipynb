    "# PySub Tutorial 4 - Advaned plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth example case for building! We are going to use the previously determined subsidence model from Tutorial 1 to display the resulting data in various ways which might be common when making figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial can be found in the folder \"Tutorials\", in the folder where your PySub package has been installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case we are studying is a the result of Tutorial 1, so make sure you have run that code so the model file is saved in the Tutorial 1 folder. The goal is to familiarize you with the PySub model, it's syntax and functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PySub modules used in this tutorial are: plot_utils, Geomoetries and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show you how to:\n",
    "- Adjust the plots to your liking:\n",
    "    - Change the colors of the contours\n",
    "    - Change the title\n",
    "    - Add a new legend\n",
    "    - Reuse of the figure for not implemented applications\n",
    "- Add new data to the model so it can also be plotted with the PySub plot functions\n",
    "- Adjust how the reservoirs are plotted in the figures\n",
    "- Add additional shapes to the figure\n",

    "## The code\n",
